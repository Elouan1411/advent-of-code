# Day 5: Rust

To run the solution, simply execute:

## Part 1 & 2

```bash
cargo run --release
```

## Thoughts

This day was much easier, mainly because Rust is really appropriate for this kind of task and I knew it a bit better than the previous languages.

I optimized Part 1 well, so Part 2 was actually easier than Part 1; it took me less than 2 minutes.
