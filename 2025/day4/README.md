# Day 4: Bash

To run the solution, you first need to make the scripts executable:

```bash
chmod +x part1.bash
chmod +x part2.bash
```

Then run them:

```bash
./part1.bash
# or
./part2.bash
```

## Thoughts

I was really held back by the language. I have never used Bash for doing algorithms like this, and it is not very appropriate for it (but the challenge is one language per day).

Because of this, I did not implement the optimization strategies I had in mind, as the language constraints made it too time-consuming.
